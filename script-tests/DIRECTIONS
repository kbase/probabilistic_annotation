I have created a small "genome" object with three annotated genes (one of which is the E. coli Enolase
and the other two are some other genes). Here is how to test this in your own workspace:

1: Import the genome object into a workspace
2: Modify the workspace and genome IDs in the SetUp functions of the test scripts
to point at your workspace and genome.
3: Test the functions.

Note that the "probannoid" must be the same in both the test-pa-calculate and test-pa-annotate function since
the same object is used as the output from the former and the input to the latter.

Also... since auth isnt' impemented in Python yet I hacked in just reading the .kbase_auth file so make sure
your file's location is specified in the test files or you will likely have permission denied. It will also
work with any publically-writable workspace but you won't be able to delete files from those when the script is
finished.
