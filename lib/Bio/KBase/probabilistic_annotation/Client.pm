=over 4



=item Description

A region of DNA is maintained as a tuple of four components:

                the contig
                the beginning position (from 1)
                the strand
                the length

           We often speak of "a region".  By "location", we mean a sequence
           of regions from the same genome (perhaps from distinct contigs).
