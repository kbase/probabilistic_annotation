OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------

This KBase service computes likelihoods for annotations and reactions for a given genome.
Likelihoods are computed based on similarity to genes with literature evidence and genes
in subsystems. More ambiguous role calls are given lower probabilities.

VERSION: 1.0 (Released 08/06/2013)
-----------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- This is the first release of the probabilistic_annotation service
- Add methods for probabilistic annotation (pa-annotate) and calculation of reaction probabilities (pa-calculate)
- Add method for setting and viewing the URL for the probabilistic annotation service (pa-url)

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES: 
- None

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Incorporation of gene synteny into probability calculations
