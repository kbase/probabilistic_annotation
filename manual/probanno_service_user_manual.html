<h1>Probabilistic Annotation Command Line Script User Manual</h1>
<h2>Probabilistic Annotation Overview</h2>
<p> The purpose of a the Probabilistic Annotation service is to
provide users with alternative annotations for genes, each attached
to a likelihood score, and to translate these likelihood scores into
likelihood scores for the existence of reactions in metabolic models.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Allows users to quickly assess the quality of an annotation.
  </li>
  <li>Reaction likelihood computations allow users to estimate the quality of metabolic networks
generated using the automated reconstruction tools in the KBase.
  </li>
  <li>Combining reaction likelihoods with gapfilling both directly incorporates available
genetic evidence into the gapfilling process and provides putative gene annotations automatically,
reducing the effort needed to search for evidence for gapfilled reactions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In the following overviews, we demonstrate the functions of the probabilistic_annotation service.</p>

</div><div><h3>1. Accessing Probabilistic Annotation commands</h3>
</a>
<p>The probabilistic annotation tools are available either through the <a href="http://iris.kbase.us" target="_blank">IRIS command web interface</a>
or through the
<a href="http://www.kbase.us" target="_blank">KBase Client Installation</a>.
Thus, the first step towards using the probabilsitic annotation commands is to either
familiarize yourself with IRIS in the IRIS tutorial:
<a href="http://kbase.us/for-users/tutorials/navigating-iris/" target="_blank">IRIS Overview Tutorial</a>
or to install and run the KBase Client Installation. </p>

<div><h3>2. Calculating annotation likelihoods for your genome</h3>
</a>
<p>The pa-annotate command is for calculating alternative annotations for every gene in your genome
together with their likelihoods. The current method for calculating likelihoods is based on similarity (BLAST) to genes in the
subsystems and genes with literature evidence. In the future syntenic evidence will also be incorporated in the likelihood scores.
</p>
<p>
The pa-annotate command has the following usage:
<pre><code>
	$ pa-annotate Genome_ID ProbAnno_ID [OPTIONS]
	-e, --showerror    Show any errors in execution
	--genomews         ID of workspace where Genome object is stored
	-h, --help         Display this help message, ignore all arguments
	-o, --overwrite    Overwrite existing ProbAnno object with same name
	-v, --verbose      Print verbose messages
	-w, --probannows   ID of workspace where ProbAnno object is saved
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
For example, if you have a copy of the E. coli K12 genome ('kb|g.0') in your workspace you can calculate alternative annotations and
annotation likelihoods using the following command.
<pre><code>
	$ pa-annotate 'kb|g.0' 'kb|g.0.probanno'
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
This command takes a significant amount of time to run (since it has to run BLAST against a rather large database), so it is placed on a queue and given a job ID. Use the kbws-checkjobs command to see if your job has finished running. Once it is done running the results will be saved in a ProbAnno typed object with the specified ID.
</p>
<p>
The probabilistic annotation object can be used as an input to gapfilling using the --probanno flag for kbfba-gapfill (reaction likelihoods are computed and then used to modify the weights in the objective function). See the help for that function for details.
</p>
<a name="STEP3">
</div><div><h3>3. Calculating reaction likelihoods for your genome</h3>
</a>
<p>
The pa-calculate command takes a probabilistic annotation (as generated from the <a href="#STEP2">pa-annotate command</a>) as input and calculates likelihoods for every reaction in the database (soon to be user-specified, currently it is the default database containing KEGG reactions plus reactions from several manually-curated models). 
</p>
<p>
The pa-calculate command has the following usage:
<pre><code>
	$ pa-calculate ProbAnno_ID RxnProbs_ID [OPTIONS]
	-e, --showerror       Show any errors in execution
	-h, --help            Display this help message, ignore all arguments
	-o, --overwrite       Overwrite existing RxnProbs object with same name
	--probannows          ID of workspace where ProbAnno object is stored
	-t, --templateid      ID of ModelTemplate object
	-m, --templatews      ID of workspace where ModelTemplate object is stored
	-v, --verbose         Print verbose messages
	-w, --rxnprobsws      ID of workspace where RxnProbs object is saved
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
For example, using the probabilistic annotation object for E coli as input one could compute probabilities for each reaction by running:
<pre><code>
	$ pa-calcualte 'kb|g.0.probanno' 'kb|g.0.rxnprobs'
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
Unlike pa-annotate, pa-calculate runs very quickly so it is not placed on a queue. The resulting object is of type RxnProbs and contains putative gene annotations (based on a
cutoff from the gene most likely to fulfil each role associated with the reaction) and likelihood scores. 
</p>
<a name="STEP4">
</div><div><h3>4. Getting reaction likelihoods in a human-readable form</h3>
</a>
<p>
The pa-getrxnprobs command converts a RxnProbs object into a tab-delimited table with the following columns:
<pre>
[Reaction ID]  [Probability]  [Complex_diagnostic]  [Complex_details]  [Putative_GPR]
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
Reaction ID is the ModelSEED ID for the reaction. Only reactions that have complexes associated are in the list
(others can be assumed to have a likelihood of 0 based on the currently-availble biochemistry in the model seed).
</li>
<li>
Probability is the computed likelihood of the reaction, with a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of 0.
</li>
<li>
Complex diagnostic is a string specifying whether a reaction is complex-associated or not. It is used for debugging.
</li>
<li>
Complex_details specifies details of each role associated with each complex. It lists the likelihood of each role
and whether or not any representatives of that role were present in the subsystems. If there are no roles assocaited
with the complex, it says that too. This helps you identify why a particular reaction has 0 likelihood.
</li>
<li>
Putative_GPR is the gene-protein-reaction relationship obtained by tracing back from reactions to the most likely
genes associated with those reactions.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The pa-getrxnprobs command has the following usage:
<pre><code>
        $ pa-getrxnprobs [RxnProbs ID] [Workspace]
        -h, --help         display this help message, ignore all arguments
</pre></code>

</div><div><h3>5. Using reaction or annotation likelihoods to inform model gap-filling</h3>
</a>
<p>
The kbfba-gapfill function from the FBA Modeling service is able to perform gap-filling on a metabolic model. By default, the gap-filling calculates costs for each change to a metabolic network based on
the database(s) the reactions come from, the thermodynamics of the reaction (if it would need to be changed to operate in an unfavorable direction, the cost is increased), penalties for adding transport
reactions instead of intracellular reactions, and so on. However, the kbfba-gapfill command also has an interface that accepts the outputs from the Probabilistic Annotation service (a ProbAnno or a RxnProbs
object) and uses those values to modify the costs. In this way, reactions that are more likely according to available genetic evidence are given a lower cost.
</p>
<p>
A ProbAnno object can be passed to the kbfba-gapfill command using the --probanno flag (a RxnProbs object is computed on-the-fly before performing gapfill).
</p>
<pre><code>
        $ kbfba-gapfill --probanno ProbAnno_ID --probannows ProbAnno_workspace [other_options]
</pre></code>
<p>
Alternatively, a RxnProbs object can be provided to kbfba-gapfill using the --probrxn flag.
</p>
<pre><code>
        $ kbfba-gapfill --probrxn ProbRxn_ID --probannows ProbAnno_workspace [other_options]
</pre></code>
<p>
If you choose to integrate the solution immediately (--intsol flag in kbfba-gapfill), the predicted GPRs from the RxnProbs object will automatically be added to the model. If you want to integrate the
solution afterward (using kbfba-integratesolution) and integrate the GPRs from a RxnProbs object, just pass the rxnprobs object into the kbfba-integratesolution function:
</p>
<pre><code>
        $ kbfba-integratesolution --rxnprobs RxnProbs_ID -f GapfillSolution_ID Model_ID [other_options]
</pre></code>
