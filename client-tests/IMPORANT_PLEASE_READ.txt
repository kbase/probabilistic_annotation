When running the tests please MAKE SURE to edit the test.cfg to use the KBase ID's user name and password. Then start the service,
and finally you should be able to run "make test" and it will work.

If you get "connection refused" it could be due to a UWSGI bug. Basically, stopping the server in certain ways destroys the process PID
file but doesn't actially stop the service. Check netstat -lp and kill whatever UWSGI instance is using up port
7073 (which is the assigned port for probabilistic annotation) before starting up the server again.
