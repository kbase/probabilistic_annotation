When running the tests please MAKE SURE to use the deploy_test.cfg and NOT deploy.cfg as the configuration file for deployment.

I'm working on automating this but haven't managed to get it to work correctly. deploy.cfg is set up for production (downloads the "real"
static data files from Shock). deploy_test.cfg is set up for testing and uses miniaturized versions of the static data files
to speed up tests and to avoid having to connect to an external server.
