Probabilistic Annotation
========================

The purpose of the Probabilistic Annotation service is to provide users with
alternative annotations for genes, each attached to a likelihood score, and to
translate these likelihood scores into likelihood scores for the existence of
reactions in metabolic models.  With the Probabilistic Annotation service:

* Users can quickly assess the quality of an annotation.

* Reaction likelihood computations allow users to estimate the quality of
  metabolic networks generated using the automated reconstruction tools in
  other services.

* Combining reaction likelihoods with gap filling both directly incorporates
  available genetic evidence into the gap filling process and provides putative
  gene annotations automatically, reducing the effort needed to search for
  evidence for gap filled reactions.
